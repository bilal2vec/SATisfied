# SATisfied


A prototype SAT prep app built by [Aishah Khan](https://github.com/AKhan-20) and [Bilal Khan](https://github.com/bkkaggle) for Manageering Inc, open-sourced under the MIT [License](https://github.com/bkkaggle/SATisfied/blob/main/LICENSE). [Here's] a Figma design file that shows a little more about how the app looks :)
